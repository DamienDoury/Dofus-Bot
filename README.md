I. The idea.
-----

My brother was playing this game all the time. By playing, I mean he was doing the same dumb action repeatedly in order to gain experience in his virtual job.

I told him to stop because that was a stupid game and he was acting like a robot... so I decided to make him a robot!


II. What is this bot doing?
-----

This bot is designed to mow weat and eventually battle the scarecrows that can appear.

I made it in C++ using Windows libraries to control the mouse and keyboard.

To get the data from the game, I read the pixels on the screen.

Then, depending on what I read, I do different actions.

As this program is getting control over your mouse and keyboard, that's pretty funny to watch it playing... but a problem when you want to use your computer for something else :D
